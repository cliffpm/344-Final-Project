# 344-Final-Project
Skin Cancer classification final project

Status 11/26/25:
  - Deployed model and ran 20 epochs on 80 % training 20% validation split.
  - Graphed validation and training accuracies along with validation and training losses.
  - Noticed that validation accuracy reaches near 95%. This is indicating overfitting where our model is starting to memorize some of that training data.
  - Next steps are to iplement techniques that address overfitting, one is dropout that we learned in lecture.
